# Error Handling and Observability Diagram Explanation

## Diagram Overview

This flowchart diagram illustrates the **comprehensive error handling and observability strategy** for the Unified Data Ingestion SDK/API system. It shows how the system detects, processes, and recovers from various types of failures while providing complete visibility into system operations.

## What This Diagram Shows

### Error Handling Flow

The diagram demonstrates how errors flow through the system:

1. **Error Detection**: Orchestrator receives errors from backend systems
2. **Error Classification**: System categorizes errors by type and severity
3. **Recovery Strategy**: Different recovery approaches based on error type
4. **Observability**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring throughout

### Error Categories

The system handles three main error types:

#### Transient Errors

- **Definition**: Temporary failures that may succeed on retry
- **Examples**: Network timeouts, temporary service unavailability
- **Strategy**: Apply retry with exponential backoff
- **Recovery**: Automatic retry up to maximum attempts

#### Permanent Errors

- **Definition**: Failures that won't succeed on retry
- **Examples**: Invalid data format, authentication failures
- **Strategy**: Return error immediately to client
- **Recovery**: No automatic retry, client intervention required

#### Partial Success Scenarios

- **Definition**: Some operations succeed while others fail
- **Examples**: Data Cloud write succeeds, indexing fails
- **Strategy**: Execute compensation actions as needed
- **Recovery**: Depends on business requirements and atomicity needs

## Assignment Requirements Addressed

- **Efficiency**: Avoid retrying permanent errors that will never succeed
- **User Experience**: Return appropriate error messages based on error type
- **Resource Conservation**: Don't waste resources on futile retry attempts

### 3. Structured Logging Approach

**Decision**: Use structured logs with consistent schema  
**Rationale**:

- **Searchability**: Structured data enables efficient log queries
- **Automation**: Consistent format enables automated log processing
- **Correlation**: Easy to correlate logs across different components
- **Analytics**: Enables log-based analytics and insights

### 4. Comprehensive Observability

**Decision**: Implement logs, metrics, and alerts throughout the system  
**Rationale**:

- **Operational Excellence**: Complete visibility into system health and performance
- **Proactive Monitoring**: Alerts enable proactive issue resolution
- **Performance Optimization**: Metrics identify optimization opportunities
- **Compliance**: Audit trails for regulatory requirements

## Process Description

### Error Handling Workflow

This diagram describes the **error detection and recovery process**:

1. **Normal Operation**: Client request flows through system normally
2. **Error Detection**: Backend systems return errors to Orchestrator
3. **Error Analysis**: Error Handler classifies error type and severity
4. **Recovery Decision**: System chooses appropriate recovery strategy
5. **Recovery Execution**: Retry, compensation, or error return as appropriate
6. **Observability**: All events logged and metrics updated throughout

### Observability Data Flow

The system generates multiple types of observability data:

- **Structured Logs**: Detailed event information with correlation IDs
- **Metrics**: Quantitative performance and health indicators
- **Alerts**: Real-time notifications for critical issues

## Open Questions and Design Considerations

The diagram includes several critical questions that need resolution:

### 1. Partial Success Handling

**Questions**:

- Is partial success acceptable?
- Do we need compensation/rollback mechanisms?

**Considerations**:

- **Business Requirements**: Some use cases may require atomicity
- **Complexity**: Compensation logic significantly increases system complexity
- **Performance**: Distributed transactions impact performance
- **Current Behavior**: Existing systems may already handle partial success

**Design Decision**: Accept partial success with comprehensive monitoring and optional compensation

### 2. Idempotency Requirements

**Questions**:

- What are exact idempotency requirements?
- How should the system detect duplicates?

**Considerations**:

- **Client Behavior**: How do clients handle retries?
- **Detection Window**: How long to remember previous requests?
- **Storage**: Where to store idempotency keys?
- **Performance**: Impact on request latency

**Design Decision**: Use correlation IDs with configurable duplicate detection window

### 3. Observability Scope

**Questions**:

- What metrics are required for MVP?
- What's the preferred monitoring stack?

**Considerations**:

- **MVP Simplicity**: Balance observability with development speed
- **Tool Integration**: Compatibility with existing monitoring tools
- **Cost**: Monitoring infrastructure costs
- **Operational Capabilities**: Team's monitoring expertise

**Design Decision**: Start with essential metrics, expand based on operational needs

## Observability Implementation Details

### Structured Logging Schema

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "component": "Orchestrator",
  "correlationId": "req_12345",
  "transactionId": "txn_67890",
  "event": "write_operation",
  "details": {
    "backend": "DataCloudSDK",
    "latency": 150,
    "success": true
  }
}
```

### Key Metrics

- **Request Latency**: End-to-end processing time per request
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of failed requests by error type
- **Backend Latency**: Response time from each backend system
- **Retry Count**: Number of retry attempts per request
- **Throughput**: Requests processed per second

### Alert Conditions

- **High Error Rate**: Error rate exceeds threshold (e.g., 5%)
- **High Latency**: Average latency exceeds SLA (e.g., 500ms)
- **Backend Unavailability**: Backend system returning continuous errors
- **Queue Depth**: Batch processing queue depth exceeds threshold

## Error Recovery Strategies

### Retry Strategy

```typescript
const retryConfig = {
  maxRetries: 3,
  baseDelay: 100, // 100ms
  maxDelay: 5000, // 5 seconds
  backoffMultiplier: 2,
  jitter: true, // Add randomness to prevent thundering herd
};

async function retryOperation(operation, config) {
  for (let attempt = 0; attempt <= config.maxRetries; attempt++) {
    try {
      return await operation();
    } catch (error) {
      if (attempt === config.maxRetries || !isRetryableError(error)) {
        throw error;
      }

      const delay = Math.min(
        config.baseDelay * Math.pow(config.backoffMultiplier, attempt),
        config.maxDelay
      );

      await sleep(config.jitter ? addJitter(delay) : delay);
    }
  }
}
```

### Compensation Actions

For partial success scenarios:

- **Data Cloud Success, Index Failure**: Queue index operation for later retry
- **Index Success, Data Cloud Failure**: Log for manual data recovery
- **Batch Processing Failures**: Move failed items to dead letter queue

## Business Impact

### Reliability Improvements

- **Higher Success Rate**: Retry mechanisms handle transient failures
- **Faster Recovery**: Automated error handling reduces manual intervention
- **Better User Experience**: Appropriate error messages guide user actions

### Operational Benefits

- **Reduced MTTR**: Faster problem identification and resolution
- **Proactive Monitoring**: Issues detected before user impact
- **Performance Insights**: Metrics guide optimization efforts

### Development Benefits

- **Easier Debugging**: Correlation IDs simplify troubleshooting
- **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive logging improves testing
