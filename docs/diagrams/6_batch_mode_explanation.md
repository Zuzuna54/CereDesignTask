# Batch Mode Diagram Explanation

## Diagram Overview

This flowchart diagram illustrates the **batching system architecture** for the Unified Data Ingestion SDK/API. It shows how the system handles high-volume data ingestion through batching when `dataCloudWriteMode: "batch"` is specified, providing an alternative to real-time processing for efficiency optimization.

## What This Diagram Shows

### Batching Decision Flow

The diagram shows how the system **decides between batched and direct processing**:

1. **Client Request**: Application sends data with batching metadata
2. **Rules Processing**: System interprets `dataCloudWriteMode: "batch"`
3. **Batching Decision**: Orchestrator checks if batching is enabled
4. **Route Selection**: Data flows either to batching system or direct write

### Three Batching Approaches

The diagram presents **three possible batching implementations**:

#### Approach 1: Local SDK Buffer

- **Implementation**: Buffer data within the SDK client
- **Trigger**: Periodic flush based on time or size thresholds
- **Pros**: Simple, low latency, no additional infrastructure
- **Cons**: Limited reliability, lost data if client crashes

#### Approach 2: Queue-Based (Recommended)

- **Implementation**: Message queue with dedicated batch processor service
- **Trigger**: Batch processor consumes from queue on schedule
- **Pros**: Reliable, scalable, fault-tolerant
- **Cons**: Additional infrastructure, slightly higher latency

#### Approach 3: Microservice

- **Implementation**: Dedicated batch ingestion API service
- **Trigger**: Service handles batching logic independently
- **Pros**: Service isolation, independent scaling
- **Cons**: Most complex, additional service to maintain

## Assignment Requirements Addressed

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-2: Metadata-Driven Processing**: Batching activated through metadata specification
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduces overhead for high-volume data ingestion
- **Flexibility**: Optional feature that can be enabled/disabled per use case

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Scalability**: Batching improves system throughput for high-volume scenarios
- **Efficiency**: Reduces API call overhead and improves resource utilization
- **Reliability**: Queue-based approach provides fault tolerance

### Architecture Requirements

- **Optional Component**: Diagram shows batching as optional/feature-flagged
- **Integration**: Fits seamlessly into existing architecture without breaking changes

## Design Decisions Made

### 1. Feature Flag Approach

**Decision**: Make batching optional and feature-flagged  
**Rationale**:

- **MVP Simplicity**: Can launch without batching complexity
- **Gradual Rollout**: Enable batching for specific use cases as needed
- **Risk Mitigation**: Avoid early complexity that might delay launch
- **Flexibility**: Different clients can opt into batching based on their needs

### 2. Queue-Based Recommendation

**Decision**: Recommend Approach 2 (queue-based) for production  
**Rationale**:

- **Reliability**: Message queues provide durability and fault tolerance
- **Scalability**: Can scale batch processing independently
- **Monitoring**: Queue depth provides observability into batching performance
- **Industry Standard**: Well-understood pattern for high-volume processing

### 3. Metadata-Driven Activation

**Decision**: Control batching through processing metadata  
**Rationale**:

- **Consistent Interface**: Same metadata pattern as other processing options
- **Per-Request Control**: Clients can choose batching per data type
- **Runtime Flexibility**: Can modify batching behavior without code changes
- **Clear Intent**: Explicit declaration of batching requirements

### 4. Multiple Implementation Options

**Decision**: Document multiple approaches rather than prescribing one  
**Rationale**:

- **Context Dependent**: Different organizations have different constraints
- **Evolution Path**: Can start simple and evolve to more sophisticated approaches
- **Trade-off Visibility**: Makes architectural trade-offs explicit
- **Implementation Flexibility**: Allows choice based on operational capabilities

## Process Description

### Batching Workflow

This diagram describes the **batching decision and processing flow**:

1. **Request Reception**: Client sends data with `dataCloudWriteMode: "batch"`
2. **Metadata Processing**: Rules Interpreter recognizes batching request
3. **Batching Check**: Orchestrator checks if batching is enabled
4. **Route Decision**: System routes to either batching system or fallback to direct write
5. **Batch Processing**: Data accumulates until batch conditions met
6. **Batch Execution**: Accumulated data sent to Data Cloud SDK in batch
7. **Confirmation**: Success confirmations sent back to clients

### Batch Triggers

Different approaches use different batch triggers:

- **Size-Based**: Batch when accumulated data reaches size threshold
- **Time-Based**: Batch when time interval expires
- **Count-Based**: Batch when number of items reaches threshold
- **Hybrid**: Combine multiple triggers for optimal batching

## Open Questions and Design Considerations

The diagram includes several open questions that need resolution:

### 1. MVP Requirements

**Question**: Is batching required for MVP or can it be feature-flagged?  
**Impact**: Affects initial development scope and complexity  
**Recommendation**: Feature-flag for gradual rollout after core functionality

### 2. Batch Parameters

**Question**: What are the batch size and interval requirements?  
**Considerations**:

- **Latency vs. Throughput**: Larger batches = higher throughput, higher latency
- **Memory Usage**: Batch size affects memory requirements
- **Error Recovery**: Larger batches = more data at risk during failures

### 3. Implementation Location

**Question**: Where should batching occur (SDK, central service, etc.)?  
**Considerations**:

- **Reliability**: Central service more reliable than client-side
- **Latency**: Client-side batching has lower latency
- **Operational Complexity**: Central service requires more infrastructure

### 4. Failure Handling

**Question**: How to handle failures in batched data?  
**Considerations**:

- **Partial Failures**: What if some items in batch fail?
- **Retry Logic**: How to retry failed batches?
- **Dead Letter Queues**: Where to send persistently failing data?

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Batching Advantages

1. **Reduced API Calls**: Fewer individual requests to downstream systems
2. **Lower Overhead**: Amortized connection and processing costs
3. **Better Throughput**: Higher overall data processing rate
4. **Resource Efficiency**: Better utilization of downstream system resources

### Batching Disadvantages

1. **Increased Complexity**: Additional components and failure modes
2. **Delayed Persistence**: Data not immediately stored (latency increase)
3. **Monitoring Requirements**: Need to monitor batch queue depths and processing
4. **Memory Usage**: Batching requires buffering data in memory

## Use Case Applications

### High-Volume Scenarios

Batching is particularly beneficial for:

- **Drone Telemetry**: High-frequency sensor data during cruise flight
- **Video Processing**: Multiple video chunks from the same session
- **Bulk Data Migration**: Large data migration projects
- **Analytics Events**: High-volume user behavior tracking

### Real-Time Scenarios

Batching is NOT suitable for:

- **Emergency Alerts**: Immediate processing required
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Instant availability needed
- **Interactive Applications**: User-facing features requiring immediate feedback

## Technical Implementation Details

### Queue-Based Implementation

For the recommended queue-based approach:

```typescript
// Client-side usage
const result = await unifiedSDK.writeData(telemetryData, {
  processing: {
    dataCloudWriteMode: "batch",
    indexWriteMode: "realtime",
  },
  batchOptions: {
    maxBatchSize: 100,
    maxWaitTime: 30000, // 30 seconds
  },
});

// System routes to message queue
// Batch processor consumes and writes to Data Cloud SDK
```

### Configuration Options

- **Batch Size**: Maximum items per batch (e.g., 100 records)
- **Time Interval**: Maximum wait time (e.g., 30 seconds)
- **Queue Configuration**: Dead letter queues, retry policies
- **Monitoring**: Queue depth alerts, processing rate metrics

## Relevance to Project

### Performance Optimization

Batching addresses **high-volume data scenarios**:

- **Cost Reduction**: Fewer API calls reduce operational costs
- **Throughput Improvement**: Better resource utilization
- **Scalability**: Handles traffic spikes more efficiently

### Operational Benefits
